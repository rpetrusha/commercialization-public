# WinPE: Add packages (Optional Components Reference)


Add feature packages, also known as optional components, to Windows PE (WinPE).

**Languages**: When you install each optional component, you must first install the language-neutral optional component and then install the language-specific optional component. The required language resources must be the same version as the language-neutral resources. Language resources are in a folder that has the same name as the language that is installed in the directory of optional components.

## <span id="bkmk_1"></span><span id="BKMK_1"></span>Adding optional components


Optional components are included as part of the Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit (Windows ADK), in 32- and 64-bit architectures. When you add optional components to your WinPE image, make sure your optional components are from the same ADK build and have the same architecture as your WinPE image. You can find WinPE optional components in the following locations after you install the ADK.

**64-bit** C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Windows Kits\\10\\Assessment and Deployment Kit\\Windows Preinstallation Environment\\amd64\\WinPE\_OCs\\

**32-bit** C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Windows Kits\\10\\Assessment and Deployment Kit\\Windows Preinstallation Environment\\x86\\WinPE\_OCs\\

### **Get the Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit with Windows PE tools including optional components**

-   Install the [Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit (Windows ADK)](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=526803), including the Windows PE feature.

### **Create a set of either 32-bit or 64-bit Windows PE files**

1.  Click **Start**, and type **deployment**. Right-click **Deployment and Imaging Tools Environment** and then select **Run as administrator**.

2.  In the **Deployment Tools and Imaging Environment**, copy the Windows PE files for the PCs you want to boot.

    -   The 64-bit version can boot 64-bit UEFI and 64-bit BIOS PCs.

        ```
        copype amd64 C:\WinPE_amd64
        ```

    -   The 32-bit version can boot 32-bit UEFI, 32-bit BIOS, and 64-bit BIOS PCs.

        ```
        copype x86 C:\WinPE_x86
        ```

### **Mount the Windows PE boot image**

-   Mount the Windows PE image.

    ```
    Dism /Mount-Image /ImageFile:"C:\WinPE_amd64\media\sources\boot.wim" /index:1 /MountDir:"C:\WinPE_amd64\mount"
    ```

### **Add optional components (packages or .cab files)**

1.  Add the optional component into Windows PE. To add optional components, you need to add both the optional component and its associated language packs.

    ```
    Dism /Add-Package /Image:"C:\WinPE_amd64\mount" /PackagePath:"C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Assessment and Deployment Kit\Windows Preinstallation Environment\amd64\WinPE_OCs\WinPE-HTA.cab"  

    Dism /Add-Package /Image:"C:\WinPE_amd64\mount" /PackagePath:"C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Assessment and Deployment Kit\Windows Preinstallation Environment\amd64\WinPE_OCs\en-us\WinPE-HTA_en-us.cab"
    ```

    **Important**  
    Some optional components have prerequisites that must be installed in order. See the list of optional components on this page.

     

2.  Verify that the optional component is part of the image:

    ```
    Dism /Get-Packages /Image:"C:\WinPE_amd64\mount"
    ```

    Review the resulting list of packages and verify that the list contains the optional component and its associated language pack.

### **Add more languages to images that include optional components**

1.  List the optional components in the Windows PE image:

    ```
    Dism /Get-Packages /Image:"C:\WinPE_amd64\mount"
    ```

2.  Review the resulting list of packages, and add the corresponding language packs for each package in the image, including the base Windows PE language pack.

    ```
    Dism /Add-Package /Image:"C:\WinPE_amd64\mount" /PackagePath:"C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Assessment and Deployment Kit\Windows Preinstallation Environment\amd64\WinPE_OCs\fr-fr\lp.cab"

    Dism /Add-Package /Image:"C:\WinPE_amd64\mount" /PackagePath:"C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Assessment and Deployment Kit\Windows Preinstallation Environment\amd64\WinPE_OCs\fr-fr\WinPE-HTA_fr-fr.cab"
    ```

    where … WinPE\_OCs\\fr-fr\\lp.cab represents the base Windows PE language pack.

3.  If you're adding language packs for Japan, Korea, or China, add the font packages for these languages. Here's an example for Japan:

    ```
    Dism /Add-Package /Image:"C:\WinPE_amd64\mount" /PackagePath:"C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Assessment and Deployment Kit\Windows Preinstallation Environment\amd64\WinPE_OCs\WinPE-Font Support-JA-JP.cab"
    ```

4.  Verify that the language packs are part of the image:

    ```
    Dism /Get-Packages /Image:"C:\WinPE_amd64\mount"
    ```

    Review the resulting list of packages and verify that the for each optional component, including the base Windows PE image, that there is an associated language pack.

5.  Change the regional settings to the language you'd like to use:

    ```
    Dism /Set-AllIntl:en-US /Image:"C:\WinPE_amd64\mount"
    ```

    To switch languages while in Windows PE, use `wpeutil setmuilanguage`.

### **Unmount the Windows PE image and create media**

1.  Unmount the Windows PE image.

    ```
    Dism /Unmount-Image /MountDir:"C:\WinPE_amd64\mount" /commit
    ```

2.  Create bootable media, such as a USB flash drive.

    ```
    MakeWinPEMedia /UFD C:\WinPE_amd64 F:
    ```

3.  Boot the media. Windows PE starts automatically. After the Windows PE window appears, the wpeinit command runs automatically. This may take a few minutes. Verify your customizations.
